        <h2>Plushies & the Mundane</h2>
        <i>Published on April 24th, 2025 by Ajax Freyr</i>

        Dear Internet,<br>
        I want to share the whimsy I’ve been cultivating in my life as of recently.<br>
        <br>
        For a couple of months, I’ve been trying to make my dorm actually mine. Personalizing my own space is something I’ve been struggling with for a couple years, since I’ve been moving all over the state (and country!) ever since 2021. I hang up hella 
        stuff on the walls, have books on my shelves, display my accessories on the vanity, etcetera… but my bed is ALWAYS barren. So when the school year started, I brought up some of my plushies from home. Let me introduce you to my new fuzzy friends, 
        and to the gijinkas I made of them!

            <div>
                <p>
                    Knuff holds a very special place in my heart. My mom bought me a bunny plush when I was an infant, and read the original Knuffle Bunny book to me countless times throughout my childhood. 
                    He’s been with me for over 20 years now! I honestly can’t believe he doesn’t look like absolute crap. I included the yellow and blue from the original book color scheme. I also gave him 
                    a blonde bob because that’s how I used to look as a kid, lol. 
                </p>

                shirt with yellow polka dots, brown overalls, and a
                hat modelled after a brown rabbit.">

            <summary>Squeak the Pachamari & Squeeze the Tangela</summary>
            <div>
                <p>
                    I keep these two together on the bed, shelf, or desk wherever I move. I bought Squeak for myself, and Squeeze was a Christmas gift from my mom. They’ve been a staple in my rooms throughout 
                    the years… I love them so much. As you can probably guess, Squeak squeaks when squeezed. Which is why I named them Squeak and Squeeze. Ugh, too many words. Anyway, I think they’d be childhood 
                    buds that play in the dirt and eat mud cakes together. Maybe I’ll draw them more soon!
                </p>

                One of them looks like Tangela from Pokemon, with light
                blue vines as hair and pitch black skin. They're wearing
                a sleeveless dark blue jumpsuit with big, chunky pink boots.
                The other child is modelled after Pachamari from Overwatch.
                Their skin is tan, with their hair and lower torso being
                white. Their lower half is large and round, with green tentacles
                sticking out from underneath.">

            <div>
                <p>
                    I originally got them to impress my ex from when I was like, 14, who was super into Pikmin. LOL. I still love my lil guy, though. I keep them around to store my extra piercing jewelry in. 
                    They’re a real rockstar to me. I like how I gave them a mullet kinda getup where their stem meets their head. And the striped bangs sell the look for sure.

                Modeled after a yellow Pikmin, they have long elf-like ears and
                yellow skin. Their messy hair gradients from yellow to red, with
                a strand in the front having a striped pattern. They're wearing a
                full-body green jumpsuit with lots of silver jewelry.">

            <div>
                <p>
                    I snagged her from Walmart when I was moving between my summer and fall housing in 2024. I had shipped a bunch of my stuff back home because I was moving from an apartment to a single 
                    dorm, so I was sad that I didn’t have many plushies. Thus, I took the softest one home. She’s adorable, and my favorite to hug while I drift off to sleep. She’s real solid too, so she 
                    serves as a good pillow when I need it. I gave her a prehensile tail and spiky hair to complement her round design (especially that front bit of hair that’s spiral-y). Overall I feel 
                    like she’d be a simple gal, so I gave her a simple design.

                She is modelled after Clefairy from Pokemon, with pink skin and a cartoonish
                face. Her hair is short, with a big swirl in the front. She is wearing a simple
                white shirt with dark pink shorts. She has a long tail and small fairy-like wings.">

            <summary>Crash the Shark</summary>
            <div>
                <p>
                    My most recent purchase, actually! I love him so much, he’s really nice to scream into and hug.I made him a super cool surfer dude who has a pet shark. But Crash is actually the shark, 
                    he’s just using the surfer dude as a vessel. Venom/Eddie Brock type situation. I also gave him a lil tutu because he’s comfortable in his masculinity :)
                </p> 
                <img src="/weblog/images/Crash.png"
                alt="A drawing of a front and back view of a buff character. He has long
                teal and white hair with pale but sunburnt skin. He wears dark, sharp sunglasses
                with a shark wrapped around his neck. His long pants and short tutu are both hot pink,
                with his pants being ripped near his knees.">

        <br>
        I think of all my plushies as a big family. Crash and Bubbles as the parents, Capsaicin as the edgy teen, and the rest being kids. Oh god, I can feel the lore forming in my head…
        <br><br>
        Other than giving unnecessary lore to my plushies, I’ve been trying to appreciate the small details in life more. You know, the mundane and ordinary stuff that I otherwise wouldn’t notice if I hadn’t had more time on my hands.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <bold>Things I've noticed recently:</bold>
        <li>The patterns shifting on my roommate’s bed when the afternoon sun shines through our blinds</li>
        <li>How my crocs squeak when I walk</li>
        <li>My friends’ subtle vocal changes when they start talking about something or someone they love</li>
        <li>The rotation of trinkets my roommate leaves on her vanity and desk</li>
        <li>How the tall grasses near the pond grow greener and greener every day</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    There are always more observations to be had in the mundane. And I can’t wait to discover them as I move through life. Maybe I’ll include a list of my ordinary observations at the end of each weblog… if I can remember it.
    <br><br>
    That’s all for today. I hope everyone is enjoying the nice weather!
