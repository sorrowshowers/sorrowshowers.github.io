   <h2>About the Website (SORROWSHOWERS)</h2>
   <p><bold>Currently this site is a massive work in progress!</bold></p>
   <p>This website was coded on a 2880 x 1800 pixel monitor, using VSCode. This is currently v3 of my website, and I do not have any public archives of my older layouts. I use Firefox on Windows, but I’m continuously optimizing the site for all browsers, operating systems, and screen sizes.</p>
   <p>Accessibility is important to me, as a disabled person myself. If you’ve personally encountered issues regarding accessibility on my website, please don’t hesitate to send me an email! My contact details are listed on the sidebar of this page.</p>
    <p>This site’s name is SORROWSHOWERS/sorrowshowers, stylized with <bold>either only capital letters or only undercase letters.</bold> The name comes from the alias I use online, which comes from… nothing, really. It just sounded cool when I was brainstorming a new alias to use a couple years ago.</p>

    <div class="disclaimerbox">
        <h3>Blanket Statement/Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>I think a lot of people forget that, on the Internet, there’s (almost) always another person behind the screen. That is to say, treat me like a person. I never mean any ill will– please extend grace to me, and I’ll extend grace to you.</p>

   <h2>Who's EL/Electric Lizard?</h2>
   <p>EL, short for Electric Lizard, named after the hair dye color I used to use, is my persona (a character that represents me). He’s the small green guy with spiky “hair”, stubby legs, and floating hands that you’ll see around this website. I like to doodle him a lot, so overtime he’s become synonymous with me. There’s no real significance behind his design, and he doesn’t belong to any of the stories I’ve crafted, so he’s just… here.</p>

   <h2>Academic Background</h2>
   <p>I am currently an undergraduate student at Oberlin College aiming to graduate in Spring 2027 with a B.A. in Anthropology. My specific research interests include disability/sensory studies and new media communications. I’m also interested in queer and disability activism, which meshes well with my academic interests, but I often don’t have much time for it. </p>

   <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
   <p>Outside of classes and work, my hobbies include character design, web design (no way), walking, baking and cooking, biking, rugby, playing video games, and experimenting with new artistic mediums.
    <br><br>
    Here are some of my media interests:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li><bold>Music:</bold> Destroy Boys, System of a Down, KIKUO, Limp Bizkit</li>
    <li><bold>Podcasts:</bold> Blood in the Bayou (Just Roll With It), The Magnus Archives</li>
    <li><bold>Games:</bold> Overwatch, Milk outside a bag of milk, Risk of Rain 2, Dungeons & Dragons, Dutch Blitz, Uno</li>
    <li><bold>Movies/Series:</bold> Devilman Crybaby, the Spider-Verse series, HLVRAI, Arcane, My Neighbor Totoro</li>
    <li><bold>Franchises:</bold> Vocaloid, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Marvel, Homestuck</li>
   </ul>
