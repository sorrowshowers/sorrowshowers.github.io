   <h2>About the Website (SORROWSHOWERS)</h2>
   <p><bold>Currently this site is a massive work in progress!</bold></p>
   <p>This website was coded on a 2880 x 1800px monitor, using VSCode, and is hosted via Github Pages. This is currently v3 of my website, and I do not have any public archives of my older layouts. I use Firefox on Windows 11, but I’m continuously optimizing the site for all browsers, operating systems, and screen sizes.</p>
   <p>Accessibility is important to me, as a disabled person myself. If you’ve personally encountered issues regarding accessibility on my website, please don’t hesitate to send me an email! My contact details are listed on the sidebar of this page.</p>
    <p>This site’s name is SORROWSHOWERS/sorrowshowers, stylized with <bold>either only capital letters or only undercase letters.</bold> The name comes from the alias I use online, which comes from… nothing, really. It just sounded cool when I was brainstorming a new username a couple years ago.</p>

    <div class="disclaimerbox">
        <h3>Blanket Statement/Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>I think a lot of people forget that, on the Internet, there’s (almost) always another person behind the screen. That is to say, treat me like a person. I never mean any ill will– please extend grace to me, and I’ll extend grace to you.</p>
